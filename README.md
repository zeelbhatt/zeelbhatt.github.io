## Projects

### LQR Controller to balance the inverted pendulmn

![Project Name](images/pendulmn.gif)
*Balancing an inverted pendulum by programming an LQR controller. Design of a controller by checking observabilty matrix, kalman filtering, and finally checking the controllability of the designed system.*
