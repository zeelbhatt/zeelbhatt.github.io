I am an MS Robotics from Arizona state university. I do research in machine learning with focus on 3D vision and robotics. My research is driven by a more abstract interest in shape understanding at both the structural and semantic levels. I practice a lots of Chess and a musical instrument. I beleive humans should be immortal.  

#### Technical Skills: C++, CUDA, GTSAM, PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS/ROS2
